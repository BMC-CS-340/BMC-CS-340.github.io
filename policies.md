# Policies

### Disclaimer
These policies are subject to change until the beginning of the semester and throughout the remainder of the course, at the judgment of the course staff.

All times listed on the course webpage are in Eastern Standard Time (EST).

### Support
You are not alone in this course; the course staff
are here to support you as you learn the material. It's expected that some aspects of the course will take time to master, and the best way to master challenging material is to ask questions. We will use Piazza for online questions and discussions. 

The course staff will be holding regular office hours. We have listed their times on our [Staff page](https://bmc-cs-151.github.io/staff.html).

The [Q-Center](https://www.brynmawr.edu/inside/offices-services/q-center) is a great resource as well. You can book an appointment [online](https://brynmawr.mywconline.net/).

More academic support, e.g. [peer mentors](https://www.brynmawr.edu/inside/offices-services/academic-support/academic-student-support-services/peer-mentors), [academic coaches](https://www.brynmawr.edu/inside/offices-services/academic-support/resources), and others, can be found at [https://www.brynmawr.edu/academicsupport/academic-and-student-support-services](https://www.brynmawr.edu/academicsupport/academic-and-student-support-services). Students are encouraged to reach out to the Director of Academic Support to explore effective learning, studying, test-taking, note-taking and time and stress management strategies that are essential to success in this course and college life. Students can schedule a meeting with the Director of Academic Support by visiting the Office of Academic Support website.


### Materials
The main text is Algorithm Design by Jon Kleinberg and Eva Tardos
as the required text. 

### Homework
Homework assignments are a required part of the course. Homeworks will be due Mondays before class.
Each student must submit each homework independently, but you are encouraged to discuss problems with other students and course staff. 


#### Late Work Policy
Because of the weekly problem sets, late submissions inevitably “eat” into the next set. You are better off turning in what you have already done (incomplete as it may be) by the deadline and focusing your efforts on the next set. Late begets later and thus the class has a general “no late work” policy, except for circumtsances beyond your control. All extensions must be requested at least 24 hours in advance of the deadline. Extensions will be granted based on individual circumstances. Time-management related problems are not valid reasons for extensions. Work handed in late without a previously granted extension may not be accepted.
 
### Labs
There are weekly labs. The labs are designed to be a space where you can practice your skills and apply them to the assignments.

### Academic Integrity 

At Bryn Mawr, we assume students are trustworthy and work with honesty and integrity. [Look here for information about Bryn Mawr’s Honor Code](https://www.brynmawr.edu/inside/offices-services/deans-office/academic-community-integrity).

### Collaboration Policy
It is your responsibility to understand and follow the collaboration policy in this class. The goal of the policy is to encourage collaboration while ensuring that you and your classmates really engage in earning how to solve the challenging problems you’ll see in this course. If you are ever uncertain if collaboration or certain sources are allowed, you should ask the professor.

You are encouraged to discuss the lecture material and the labs and problems with other students, subject to the following restriction: the only “product” of your discussion should be your memory/understanding of it - you may not write up solutions together, or exchange written work or computer files. The group project is the only exception to this- in this case, these collaboration rules apply to students outside of your group and you may freely work closely with students within your group. Collaboration is not allowed on examinations or quizzes.

You should not use outside sources (the internet, AI tools, other textbooks, students not in this class, etc.). Code should not be copied without permission from the author. If permission is given, code should be cited at the location it is used with a comment. If your solution is inspired by any outside resources (I understand that sometimes it is hard to not see things), you MUST cite.

### Academic Accommodations

All classes will be recorded and close-captioned. Links to lectures will be posted on the class syllabus.

Any student who has a disability-related need to record this class first must speak with the Director of Access Services, Deb Alder, as part of university policy. Class members need to be aware that this class may be recorded.

To receive an accommodation for a course activity (such as more time on exams), you must have an Accommodation Letter from the Office of Student Disability Services and you need to contact us to work out the details of your accommodation at least two weeks prior to the activity. Forms can be emailed to me, the instructor.

You are also welcome to contact us privately to discuss your academic needs. However, all disability-related accommodations must be arranged, in advance, through Student Disability Services.

Students needing academic accommodations for a disability must first register with Access Services. Students can call 610-526-7516 to make an appointment with the Director of Access Services, Deb Alder, or email her at [dalder@brynmawr.edu](mailto:dalder@brynmawr.edu) to begin this confidential process. Once registered, students should schedule an appointment with the professor as early in the semester as possible to share the verification form and make appropriate arrangements. Please note that accommodations are not retroactive and require advance notice to implement. More information can be obtained at the Access Services website: [http://www.brynmawr.edu/access-services/](http://www.brynmawr.edu/access-services/).

### Sick Policy

All are welcome to wear a mask if they so wish, but no one is mandated to wear a mask.

If you are symptomatic (coughing, sore throat, or running nose), please stay at home. Lectures will be recorded so they can be watched later. Missed lab activities will be able to be made up on your own.
